    > Currently, navigating to the **Tetris Game** page of the workshop site shows that the _feature_ is currently missing. We will address that issue in this exercise.

    ## Exercise: Integrate the **Tetris Game**

    Refer back to the Codespaces development environment created in the [prerequisite to the workshop](../../prerequisites.md#provision-a-new-cloud-development-environment-for-the-workshop). You may have to restart the Codespace if it stopped due to inactivity.

    ### **Explore**

    1. On the **`TERMINAL`** view at the bottom, notice that a local site server is already running.

           Looking at the build log in the terminal, you can see a warning like the one in the following example.(1)
           { .annotate }

           1. ðŸ’¡ The warning gives a cue to addressing the Tetris Game integration issue. We shall implement the fix in later steps!

           ![site build warning](../../assets/img/build-warning.png)

    ### **Develop locally**

    2. Switch to the **`PORTS`** view at the bottom panel, notice there is a **`Site (8080)`** entry in the table.

         1. Focus your :fontawesome-solid-hand-pointer: mouse pointer on the **`Site (8080)`** to reveal additional contexts.
         1. Click the **:material-file-search-outline: Preview in Editor** icon to browse the local build of the site inside of the editor's browser.(1)
           { .annotate }

             1. - :warning: **Only you currently have access to the published site.**
                - :bulb: You may instead click the **:octicons-globe-16:** icon associated with **`Site (8080)`** entry to view the site in your normal browser.

            To open access to other stakeholder

            1. Right click on the **`Site (8080)`** entry
            2. In the popup menu, set the mouse pointer on the **Port Visibility** item and select the **Public** option.
                ![Set port visibility to public](../../assets/img/change-port-visibility.png){ style="width: 40em" }

            !!! tip ":octicons-goal-16:{ style="color: red" } Facilitate Collaboration"
            
                Now, other stakeholders you share the site URL with can access the site. Consequently, they can also assess your ongoing work and can collaborate with timely feedbacks.


    3. Rename the `docs/.tetris.game` folder to `docs/tetris.game` without the `.` prefix
    4. Find and open the file `mkdocs.yml` in the File Explorer (it's at the root of the file tree)

          - Fix the  the Tetris Game relevant entry and point the value of the entry to the `tetris.game` folder

            ```yaml linenums="152" hl_lines="21"
            nav:
            - index.md

            - Tetris Game: tetris.game/index.html #(1)
            ```

            1.  Here, change `.tetris.game/index.html` to `tetris.game/index.html`.

    5. Observe the local build in the terminal and do a manual test of the integration
    6.  Add automated checks by creating the following workflows

        ```yaml title=".github/workflows/1.1.continuous.integration.yml"
        --8<-- ".github.reference/workflows/1.1.continuous.integration.yml"
        ```

        ```yaml title=".github/workflows/1.2.continuous.integration.yml"
        --8<-- ".github.reference/workflows/1.2.continuous.integration.yml"
        ```
    7.  Commit the changes to a new branch and push it

        ```bash
        git checkout -b integrate-tetris-game
        git add .
        git commit -m "Integrate tetris game"
        git push -u origin integrate-tetris-game
        ```
